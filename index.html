                        percent of their original range. In the wild, they live in small, fragmented populations on two
                        Philippine islands. Threats include habitat destruction, population fragmentation, and hunting.
                        These pigs indulge in mud baths during the day to cool down and forage when temperatures are
                        cooler at dawn, dusk, or during the night. Pigs have an excellent sense of smell and can locate
                        food many feet underground.

                        Tarsiers have the largest eyes relative to body size of any mammal. Each eyeball is around 16
                        millimeters in diameter, which is as large as the tarsier’s entire brain. The eyes are so large
                        that they can’t rotate them. Instead, tarsiers can twist their necks a full 180 degrees in
                        either direction, just like owls.
                        Tarsiers are the only entirely carnivorous primate.
                        Tarsiers get their name from the extraordinarily elongated tarsus bones in their feet. While the
                        tarsier’s head and body are 4 to 6 inches in length, their hind legs and feet are twice as long.
                        They also have a long, usually hairless tail that adds an extra 8 or 9 inches.

                        The Rufous-headed Hornbill (Aceros waldeni), also known as the Visayan Wrinkled Hornbill, Walden's Hornbill or Writhed-billed Hornbill, is a critically endangered species of hornbill living in the rainforests on the islands of Negros and Panay in the Philippines.

                        This is a critically endangered species. Rufous-headed Hornbills reproduce very slowly and thus are unable to survive high hunting pressures coupled with heavy logging of the rainforests. It is presumed extinct on Guimaras and now survives only on Negros and Panay.

                        Manny Pacquiao, in full Emmanuel Dapidran Pacquiao, byname Pac-Man, (born December 17, 1978, Kibawe, Bukidnon province, Mindanao, Philippines), professional boxer, media celebrity, and politician who became world-famous for winning boxing titles in more weight classes than any other boxer in history. 
His rise from abject poverty to the pinnacle of his sport was made even more remarkable by his life outside the ring. The charismatic  “Pac-Man” was an idol and a unifying force in the Philipinnes, where his unprecedented popularity led to commercial endorsements, movies, television shows, CDs, and his image on a postage stamp.

Over the next several years, Pacquiao engaged in a series of high-profile fights, winning the World Boxing Association (WBA) and IBF featherweight titles, the WBC and The Ring’s junior lightweight titles, and the WBC lightweight title.

                        José Rizal (1861-1896) was a national hero of the Philippines and the first Asian nationalist. He expressed the growing national consciousness of many Filipinos who opposed Spanish colonial tyranny and aspired to attain democratic rights.

José Rizal was born in Calamba, Laguna, on June 19, 1861, to a well-to-do family. He studied at the Jesuit Ateneo Municipal in Manila and won many literary honors and prizes. He obtained a bachelor of arts degree with highest honors in 1877. For a time he studied at the University of Santo Tomas, and in 1882 he left for Spain to enter the Central University of Madrid, where he completed his medical and humanistic studies.

                        Fort Santiago built in 1571, is a citadel built by Spanish navigator and governor Miguel López de Legazpi for the new established city of Manila in the Philippines. The defense fortress is located in Intramuros, the walled city of Manila.
The fort is one of the most important historical sites in Manila. Several lives were lost in its prisons during the Spanish Empire and World War II. José Rizal, one of the Philippine national heroes, was imprisoned here before his execution in 1896. The Rizal Shrine museum displays memorabilia of the hero in their collection and the fort features, embedded onto the ground in bronze, his footsteps representing his final walk from his cell to the location of the actual execution.

                        The Manila Ocean Park is a oceanarium in Manila, Philippines. It is owned by China Oceanis Philippines Inc., a subsidiary of China Oceanis Inc., a Singaporean-registered firm. It is located behind the Quirino Grandstand at Rizal Park. The construction involved erecting structural pillars at the beachfront and constructing the platform that would serve as the foundation of the entire building. The base structure and platform was completed and for a while served a secondary purpose as a promenade walkway until construction of the actual park continued.
The main attraction of Manila Ocean Park is the Oceanarium which houses 14,000 sea creatures from about 277 species all of which is indigenous in Southeast Asia. The Oceanarium has seven sections and contains 3,000 cubic meters (110,000 cu ft) of sea water.[5] Its main feature is the 25-meter (82 ft) 220° curved walkway tunnel after a 55-meter (180 ft) walkthrough inside the Oceanarium. The water used in the Oceanarium is derived from the Manila Bay which is filtered to be suitable to marine life.

                        Burnham Park, officially known as the Burnham Park Reservation, is a historic urban park located in downtown Baguio, Philippines. It was designed by eponymous American architect and Baguio city planner, Daniel Burnham.
                        Burnham Park was envisioned by American architect Daniel Hudson Burnham[2] as part of a larger plan for the city of Baguio in 1905.[3] After having presented the preliminary plans for Baguio and the capital city of Manila, Burnham left the task of interpreting such plans to William E. Parsons.[4] The area where Burnham Park is situated was formerly known as 'Baguio Meadow".[5]
                        Burnham's role in establishing the park is acknowledged through a bust bearing his likeness and a plaque located at one end of the park.

White Beach is divided into three boat stations – Station 1 where the sand is the finest and where most luxury resorts are located, Station 2 the busiest and most crowded due to concentration of restaurants, resorts, bars and shops, and the more laidback and less crowded Station 3 where cheaper accommodation can be found. Take note that there is no physical barrier of some sort to separate the stations. Anyone can explore any station any time of the day.

                        One of the top tourist attractions in the Philippines, The Chocolate Hills are unusual geological formations that consists of at least 1,268 individual mounds scattered throughout the interior of the island of Bohol. The almost symmetrical and same-sized formations range from 98 to 164 feet (30 to 50 meters) high and are covered in green grass. During the dry season the grass turns brow, hence the name. There is no consensus on how these giant mole hills were formed. One theory holds that the Chocolate Hills are the weathered rock formations of a kind of marine limestone on top of an impermeable layer of clay.

                        One of the most popular waterfalls in the country, Kawasan Falls is a multi-tier falls found at the foot of Mantalongan Mountain Range in Badian, Cebu.  The waterfalls are picture-perfect with the lush greenery and natural pools where people can take a refreshing dip into the cool turquoise water.
Considering that the waterfalls are found amidst the forest, an uphill hike is necessary to reach the first waterfall which is also the largest and usually crowded among the three-layer falls.  Aside from swimming, canyoneering is also a popular activity done in the area.
Some parts of Kawasan were affected when Typhoon Rai (local name Odette) hit Cebu and it’s temporarily closed for rehabilitation.

                        Kayangan Lake is a crystal-clear freshwater lake in Coron, featuring underwater rock formations, caves and islets. It’s a popular spot for photographers, for fairly obvious reasons, and is said to be the cleanest lake in all of the Philippines. The water is so clear that you can often see down to a depth of 10 metres, enabling even non-swimmers to see the untouched rock formations from viewpoints around the lake.
                        You can swim, snorkel and dive in Kayangan Lake, and hike the overlooking mountain for panoramic views of the area. Keen hikers with a tour guide can also visit a cave at the top of the mountain but may not be able to enter.
                        Swimmers wishing to jump into the lake should seek advice from guides about where the safest diving spots are, because there are some protruding sharp rocks under the water. It’s also worth noting that you won’t float as easily in the super-fresh water as you would in the sea.
                        Entrance to the lake park costs around 200 pesos and includes a tour to the Twin Lagoon and Twin Peaks. Many independent tour companies also run tours of the lake and its surroundings, including a beautiful boat tour to the lake itself.

                        Cebu is a magical island in the Philippines archipelago. While it’s full of architectural and cultural heritage, the island and surrounding islets are also a haven for natural beauty and home to some fascinating Cebu beaches. Swimming with whale sharks off the coast of the Cebu city of Oslob is a raging hit with locals and international tourists who come to Cebu, but the main attractions are these white, sandy beaches of Cebu that are to be found all over the islands.

                        Rizal Park (Filipino: Liwasang Rizal, Spanish: Parque Rizal), also known as Luneta Park or simply Luneta, is a historic urban park located in Ermita, Manila, Philippines. It is considered one of the largest urban parks in the Philippines, covering an area of 58 hectares (140 acres). The site on where the park is situated was originally known as Bagumbayan during the Spanish colonial period. It is adjacent to the historic Walled City of Intramuros.
                        Situated on the eastern shore of Manila Bay, the park plays a significant role in shaping the history of the Philippines. The execution of Filipino patriot José Rizal on December 30, 1896 in the same area fanned the flames of the 1896 Philippine Revolution against the Kingdom of Spain. The park was officially named in his honor, and the monument enshrining his remains serves as the park's symbolic focal point. The declaration of Philippine independence from the United States was held here on July 4, 1946, as well as later political rallies, including those of Ferdinand Marcos and Corazon Aquino, the latter having culminated in the EDSA Revolution in 1986.

                        The Banaue Rice Terraces (Filipino: Hagdan-hagdang Palayan ng Banawe) are terraces that were carved into the mountains of Banaue, Ifugao, in the Philippines, by the ancestors of the Igorot people. The terraces are occasionally called the "Eighth Wonder of the World".[1][2][3] It is commonly thought that the terraces were built with minimal equipment, largely by hand.[4] The terraces are located approximately 1,500 metres (4,900 feet) above sea level. These are fed by an ancient irrigation system from the rainforests above the terraces. It is said that if the steps were put end to end, it would encircle half of the globe.

                        Taal Volcano (IPA: [taʔal]; Tagalog: Bulkang Taal) is a large caldera filled by Taal Lake in the Philippines.Located in the province of Batangas, the volcano is second of the most active volcanoes in the country, with 38 recorded historical eruptions, all of which were concentrated on Volcano Island, near the middle of Taal Lake.The caldera was formed by prehistoric eruptions between 140,000 and 5,380 BP.
                        The volcano is located about 50 kilometers (31 mi) south of Manila, the capital of the Philippines.
                        Taal Volcano has had several violent eruptions in the past, causing deaths on the island and the populated areas surrounding the lake, with an overall death toll of about 6,000. Because of its proximity to populated areas and its eruptive history, the volcano was designated a Decade Volcano, worthy of close study to prevent future natural disasters. All volcanoes in the Philippines are part of the Ring of Fire.
